2. **How are revenues projected in the valuation models?**  
   - The initial growth rate and projected revenue are determined through linear regression based on historical performance. For a visual example, refer to the AAPL chart below—where the blue line represents Apple's revenue, and the purple line shows the linear regression line fitted to past revenue. From the second projection year onward, a constant revenue growth rate is applied.

3. **Which model can I use to value stocks that are currently unprofitable or experiencing significant losses?**  
   - While we don't have extensive documentation on this topic, we recommend reading the insights shared by Professor Aswath Damodaran in this paper: [Valuing Young, Start-up and Growth Companies: Estimation Issues and Valuation Challenges](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/papers/younggrowth.pdf).

4. **How do we define financial service firms?**  
   - Financial service firms pose challenges when defining debt and capital expenditures, making it difficult to estimate Free Cash Flow (FCF). Additionally, their assets are often marked to market. For a deeper understanding, refer to Professor Aswath Damodaran’s paper: [Valuing Financial Service Firms](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/papers/finfirm09.pdf).
