2. **How are revenues projected in the valuation models?**
   - The initial growth rate and the corresponding projected revenue are determined through linear regression based on past performance. For a visual representation, check out the chart for AAPL where the blue line represents Apple's revenue, and the purple line is the linear regression fitted to historical revenues. From the second projection year onward, a stable revenue growth rate is applied.

3. **Which model can I use to value stocks that are currently unprofitable, experiencing significant losses?**
   - While we may not have extensive documentation on this subject, we recommend reviewing the insights shared by Professor Aswath Damodaran in this informative paper: [Valuing Young, Start-up and Growth Companies: Estimation Issues and Valuation Challenges](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/papers/younggrowth.pdf).

4. **How do we define financial service firms?**
   - Financial service firms are characterized by challenges in defining debt and capital expenditures, making it challenging to estimate Free Cash Flow (FCF). Additionally, their assets are marked to market. For a more in-depth understanding, refer to Professor Aswath Damodaran's paper: [Valuing Financial Service Firms](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/papers/finfirm09.pdf).
