# Valuing Financial Service Firms (Banks, Insurance Companies, and Investment Banks)

Recommended models for valuing a financial service firm:
* Simple Excess Returns Model ([Example](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/GS/valuation/simple-excess-return-model/))
* Two-Stage Excess Returns Model ([Example](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/GS/valuation/two-stage-excess-return-model/))
* Simple Dividend Discount Model ([Example](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/GS/valuation/simple-dividend-discount-model/))
* Two-Stage Dividend Discount Model ([Example](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/GS/valuation/two-stage-dividend-discount-model/))
* Discounted Cash Flow to Equity (To be implemented...)

Financial service firms differ from other companies in the market and are best valued using equity valuation models rather than enterprise valuation models (such as the Discounted Free Cash Flow Model).

Why do we tend to avoid enterprise valuation models for financial service firms?

- **Mark-to-Market Accounting**: Assets on the balance sheet are valued at fair value, rather than at historical cost, as is common for non-financial firms.

- **Loss Provisions and Smoothing Earnings**: Banks can boost reported earnings by reducing their loss provisions and lending more aggressively.

- **Debt and Equity Definition**: It is difficult to clearly define debt for financial service firms.

- **Challenges in Estimating Cash Flows**: Reinvestment needs, such as capital expenditures or changes in working capital, are hard to estimate accurately.
