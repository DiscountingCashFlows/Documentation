    ## Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
    
    The Capital Asset Pricing Model describes the relationship between risk and expected return for assets, particularly stocks. Its formula is used to calculate the cost of equity, or the rate of return a company is expected to pay to equity investors.

        ## Risk-Free Rate

        The risk-free rate represents the interest an investor would expect from an absolutely risk-free investment over a specified period of time.
        By default, it is equal to the current yield of the U.S. 10 Year Treasury Bond.
