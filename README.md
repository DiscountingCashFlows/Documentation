# Documentation
The source code and documentation behind our website's valuation models, functions and more.

The source code for our models is stored in [source-code](https://github.com/DiscountingCashFlows/Documentation/tree/main/source-code)

All documentation modules are found in [models-documentation](https://github.com/DiscountingCashFlows/Documentation/tree/main/models-documentation)

Open sourcing our models supports our committment to full transparency and allows our users to fully understand the logic behind the selection of the metrics used and edit those base models or create new ones.
